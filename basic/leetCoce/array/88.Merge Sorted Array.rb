# You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, 
# representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 
# To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, 
# and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

# Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

# nums1: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
#          ↑  ↑  ↑
#          |  |  |
#          m valid elements

# nums2: [2, 5, 6]
#          ↑  ↑  ↑
#          n elements

# After merge:
# nums1: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

nums1 = [1,2,3]
nums2 = [2,5,6]
