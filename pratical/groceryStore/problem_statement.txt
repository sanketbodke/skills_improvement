Ruby Grocery Price Calculator

At the local grocery store, items are sold by quantity. 
For example, Milk costs $3.97. However, sometimes there is a sale, and customers 
can buy multiple items for a discounted price.

This week's pricing table:
Item	Unit Price	Sale Price
Milk	$3.97	2 for $5.00
Bread	$2.17	3 for $6.00
Banana	$0.99	—
Apple	$0.89	—

Sale Rules
Sale prices are applied only when the required quantity is met.
If more than the sale quantity is purchased, the extra items are charged at the unit price.
Example:
If you buy 3 Milk:

First 2 Milk → $5.00 (sale)
Third Milk → $3.97 (unit price)
Total: $5.00 + $3.97 = $8.97
